                <p class="description">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
                    applications using React and the app platform’s
                    native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well as to
                    describe the
                    appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span class="italic">bundles of reusable,
                        nestable code</span>. You
                    can learn more about
                    React in the next section. But first, let’s cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                <p class="description">React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular open source
                    library for building user
                    interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most
                    of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve
                    as a refresher
                    course.</p>
                <p class="description">We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                <p class="description"><b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                    examples:
                    friendly, approachable creatures that
                    need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                <p class="description"><b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                    elements
                    inside JavaScript like so: <span class="bg">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I
                        am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>.</p>
                <p class="description">The React docs have <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span>
                    you can refer to learn even
                    more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can
                    use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="bg">name</span> for the cat, name,
                    and embedding it with
                    curly braces inside
                    <span class="bg">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="description"><b>+ props.</b> Props is short for “properties”.</p>
                <p class="description"><b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
                    how components render, state is like a
                    component’s personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that
                    comes from user
                    interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

                <p class="description">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
                    <span class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a function to
                    be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be
                    called when the text is
                    submitted.</p>
                    <p class="description">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In this new
                    language, every single word is written the same way: 🍕. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "🍕
                    🍕".</p>
