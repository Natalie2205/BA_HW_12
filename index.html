                            examples:
                            friendly, approachable creatures that

                            <span class="bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
                            write
                            elements
                            inside JavaScript like so: <code class="bg">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I
                        am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</code>.
                        </p>

                                JSX</span>
                            you can refer to learn even
                            more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can
                            use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="bg">name</span> for the cat,
                            name,
                            and embedding it with
                            curly braces inside

                            configure
                            how components render, state is like a
                            component’s personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time
                            or
                            that
                            comes from user
                            interaction. State gives your components memory!
